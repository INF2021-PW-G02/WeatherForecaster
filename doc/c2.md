# C2 : User Interface

The user interface is very simple to use, built around [Google Material UI](https://material.io/design) design, it's also very intuitive. The front page shows us graphs with Temperature and Humidity, of a certain city (Madrid in this case), and the respective times, it also has a sandwich menu that extends the description of the icons, namely, the countries, cities, weather institutes, weather statuses, daily and hourly forecasts.

## Interface and Common features
Since our project was entirely made with the React Admin framework, the Design and Format is the default React Admin design with some minor changes and additions. For example for the dashboard we ended up using some html and css to show some of the results from the data we add on the database so the end user could understand it easier.
