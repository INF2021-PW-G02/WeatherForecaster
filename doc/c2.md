# C2 : User Interface

The user interface is very simple to use.

## Interface and Common features
Since our project was entirely made with the React Admin framework, the Design and Format is the default React Admin design with some minor changes and addictions. For example for the dashboard we ended up using some html and css to show some of the results from the data we add on the database so the end user could understand it easier.
