# C2 : User Interface

The user interface is very simple to use.

## Interface and Common features
Since our project was entirely made with the React Admin framework, the Design and Format is the default React Admin design with some minor changes and addictions. For example for the dashboard we ended up using some html and css to show some of the results from the data we add on the database so the end user could understand it easier.

### Sitemap

_Add a diagram of your (Visual) sitemap. I'm not expecting a [XML Sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/build-sitemap#expandable-1) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps))_  

_In the previous sections I'm using a table to organize the figures in the space, but it is not required_

Here are two examples of a site map
